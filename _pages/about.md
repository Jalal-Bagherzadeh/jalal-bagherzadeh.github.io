## Research
My research focuses on how macroeconomic variables shape household decision-making and, in turn, how these choices feed back into aggregate economic outcomes. To study these dynamics, I integrate large-scale microeconomic datasets into a macroeconomic framework, using structural models, time-series methods, and applied econometrics. 


## Teaching
I teach undergraduate courses in macroeconomics, microeconomics, and data analysis. My classes emphasize practical examples, economic modeling, and hands-on data work to develop strong quantitative and analytical skills.
